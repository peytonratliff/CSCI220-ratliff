                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>The Cardinals finished last season at 8-8, and have made positive moves in the free agency so far. A surge in victories seems far fetched, but gradual increase seems likely.</th>

                <th>Baltimore Ravens</th>
                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>The Baltimore Ravens finished the 2021 season 11-5, the exact same record as the Colts. Lamar Jackson is one of (if not) the premier rushing quarterback in a league that (for better or worse) is heading toward a standard of rushing quarterbacks. The Colts had the second best rushing defense in the league last year, behind only the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but accounting for Jackson is a task easier said than done. The Colt’s key to winning this game will lie in limiting the Raven’s quarterback to the pocket. Edge rusher Justin Houston and nickel cornerbacks will have their hands full this game.</th>

                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>The Buffalo Bills edged the Colts out of the playoff bracket last year in a down-to-the-wire 24-27 game. Balancing a rushing-capable Josh Allen with a strong receiving core is nothing less than a battle of attrition for any defense in the NFL. Due to that, the key for the Colts will be limiting the Bill’s offensive time and capitalizing on every chance to score.</th>

                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>The Houston Texans have absolutely struggled in the 2021 offseason. Tensions with star quarterback Deshaun Watson are so high that many analysts assume that he will refuse to play if not traded. The loss of likely future hall-of-famer J.J. Watt has done nothing good for their defense. Short of a miracle (or a classic inter-division blunder by the Colts) this game should be one of the easier victories of the season.</th>

                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>This game will be very similar to the last, except at home. This will likely be the easiest game of the season given the home field advantage. It is worth noting that this starts the Colts’ very long stretch of home games, eight in total.</th>

                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>The Jaguars with rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence will likely hold a very different dynamic than the team from the previous year. Lawrence will likely lack key skill positions surrounding him, but such is the test of a young first round quarterback. All things considered, it is far too early to make an estimation for this game.</th>

                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>The Tennessee Titans have consistently been the Colts’ toughest divisional rival over the past few seasons, and that looks like a pattern that will hold for 2021-2022. The threat of having to manage Derrick Henry always creates centerfield havoc for the Colts’ defense. The Colts’ key to victory this game is going to be limiting the Titans’ offensive time of possession and capitalizing on every chance to score.</th>

                <th>New England Patriots</th>
                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>The historically dominant New England Patriots struggled through the loss of Star quarterback Tom Brady last season, finishing 7-9. Last season was the first time since 2008 that the Patriots haven’t won their division, having lost only twice now over the past 17 seasons. Head coach Bill Belichick seems to be holding on to aging quarterback Cam Newton, who by all measures seems to be past his prime. Barring a miracle restructure from the Patriots, this game should be very winnable by Indianapolis.</th>

                <th>New York Jets</th>
                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>The New York Jets finished just 2-14 last year, the second to worst final standing second only to the Jacksonville Jaguars. With the second overall pick of the draft and young quarterback Sam Darnold, the Jets seem likely to pick up one or two quality skill players via the draft or through trade, and will hopefully fill out their trenches in the process. The Jets should be considerably better this season than last, but exactly how much better is yet to be determined. It’s too early to make an educated guess for this game.</th>

                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>The LA Rams finished 10-6 last year, slightly below the Colts’ 11-5. All things considered the Rams made an upgrade to the former Lion’s quarterback Matthew Stafford, but in the process paid a king’s ransom. The Rams are poised for greatness, but may lack a few key elements to finish the job. Should be a close game.</th>

                <th>TBA/Home</th>
                <th>The Seattle Seahawks finished with a respectable 12-4 record last season, but seem to be having trouble with their quarterback Russell Wilson. As of this writing it is unclear whether the quarterback will be remaining with the Seahawks, making game estimations not worthwhile.</th>

                <th>The Las Vegas Raiders are poised to have a season that will define their upcoming next few years. The pieces for the team are there; Quarterback Derek Carr, tight end Darren Waller, edge rusher Maxx Crosby. The team widely believes that the time for excuses is over, it’s time to get in the playoffs. This should be a fun game to watch.</th>

                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>The Miami Dolphins finished last season at a respectable 10-6, but have struggled with managing cap space in thus far in the offseason. The release of veteran linebacker Kyle Van Noy doesn’t bode will for the team, and only lateral moves appear plausible for the team at the moment. Another 10-6 season, or even something along the lines of 8-8, doesn’t seem unlikely.</th>

                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>The San Francisco 49ers finished last season at 6-10, and don’t seem to be in any advantages in the free agent market. A signing of former Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph would help solve some offensive problems, but other teams seem better poised to take that player. Another sub .500 season seems likely from this team.</th>

                <th>TBA/Away</th>
                <th>This game will likely pan out similarly to the previous Colts-Titans matchup, though the lack of a home field advantage could slightly benefit the Titans this time around.</th>
                <th>50/50</th>

                <th>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</th>
                <th>TBA/TBA</th>
                <th>Likely GOAT quarterback Tom Brady has to show his age eventually, but that time seems to be a couple years away. Rob Gronkowski seems to be a likely returner, as do receivers Antonio Brown and Mike Evans. Salary cap might take its toll somewhere along the line, but players are sometimes willing to take pay cuts to win Super Bowls, as Evans has made apparent. This team seems like a 2022 Super Bowl contender, and the Colts will have their hands full the whole time.</th>
